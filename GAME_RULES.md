# Kazhutha Kali - Complete Game Rules

## 🎴 Overview
**Kazhutha Kali** (കഴുതക്കളി) is a traditional card game from Kerala, India. The name translates to "Donkey Game" - the last player with cards becomes the "Kazhutha" (Donkey).

## 🎯 Objective
**Don't be the last player with cards!** Empty your hand as quickly as possible to avoid being the Kazhutha.

## 🃏 Setup
- **Players**: 2-6 players (best with 3-4)
- **Deck**: Standard 52-card deck
- **Deal**: All cards are dealt evenly to all players
- **Starting Player**: The player with the **Ace of Spades (♠A)** starts the first round

## 📋 How to Play

### Round 1: The First Card
1. The player holding the **Ace of Spades** must play it to start
2. This card becomes the **lead suit** (Spades in this case)
3. Play continues **clockwise** around the table

### Following Suit (The Core Rule)
When it's your turn:
- **If you have the lead suit**: You **MUST** play a card of that suit
- **If you don't have the lead suit**: You can play **any card** from your hand

### Winning a Trick (Normal Round)
If **everyone plays the same suit** (no one cuts):
- The player who played the **highest card** of that suit wins
- Card ranking: **2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9 < 10 < J < Q < K < A**
- The winner **discards all cards** from that trick (they're out of the game)
- **The winner starts the next round** with any card from their hand

**Example - Normal Trick:**
```
Lead Suit: Hearts (♥)
Player A: 5 of Hearts ♥5
Player B: King of Hearts ♥K
Player C: 7 of Hearts ♥7
Player D: Queen of Hearts ♥Q

Winner: Player B (King is highest)
Action: All 4 cards are discarded
Next: Player B starts the next round
```

### The "Pani" (The Cut) 🔥
This is what makes Kazhutha Kali exciting and strategic!

**When does it happen?**
- A player doesn't have the lead suit
- They play a card of a **different suit**
- This is called **"Cutting"** or giving **"Pani"** (punishment/work)

**What happens?**
1. **The round stops immediately** - no more cards are played
2. Find the player who played the **highest card of the LEAD suit** (not the cut card)
3. That unlucky player must **pick up ALL cards** from the center and add them to their hand
4. The player who picked up the cards **starts the next round**

**Example - Pani Scenario:**
```
Lead Suit: Hearts (♥)
Player A: 2 of Hearts ♥2
Player B: 10 of Hearts ♥10
Player C: Ace of Hearts ♥A (Highest Hearts!)
Player D: No Hearts → Plays 3 of Clubs ♣3 (THE CUT!)

Result: 
- Round stops immediately (Player D cut)
- Player C has highest Heart (Ace)
- Player C picks up all 4 cards (♥2, ♥10, ♥A, ♣3)
- Player C now has 4 more cards in hand
- Player C must start the next round
```

**Why is Pani strategic?**
- If you're winning (Ace of Hearts), you might get punished!
- If you played a low card, you're safe even if someone cuts
- Players try to force others to play high cards, then cut them

### The "Transfer of Power" Rule 👑

**What happens when the winner goes safe?**

If a player wins a trick with their **last card**, they become Safe and can't start the next round (they have no cards!). In this case:

**The privilege of starting the next round transfers to the player who played the Second Highest Card in that trick.**

**Example:**
```
Lead Suit: Hearts (♥)
Player A: Ace of Hearts ♥A (LAST CARD!)
Player B: King of Hearts ♥K
Player C: 10 of Hearts ♥10
Player D: 2 of Hearts ♥2

Result:
1. Player A wins with ♥A
2. Player A is now Safe! ✅ (emptied hand)
3. Cards are discarded (normal trick)
4. Power transfers to Player B (♥K was second highest)
5. Player B starts the next round 👑
```

**Why this matters:**
- Ensures game flow continues smoothly
- No confusion about who starts next
- Fair distribution of starting power
- Strategic depth: Sometimes you DON'T want to win with your last card!

## 🏆 Winning and Losing

### Getting Safe
- When you play your **last card**, you're "Safe" ✅
- Safe players are out of the game (in a good way!)
- You can't be the Kazhutha anymore

### The Kazhutha (Loser)
- The **last player holding cards** is the Kazhutha 🫏
- Everyone else celebrates while the Kazhutha deals next game
- In traditional rules, the Kazhutha might face a playful "punishment"

## 🎲 Strategy Tips

### 1. Avoid Playing High Cards Early
- Don't lead with Kings or Aces unless necessary
- Someone might cut and you'll pick up the pile!

### 2. Cut Strategically
- If someone plays an Ace or King, consider cutting if you can
- Make them pick up a large pile!

### 3. Empty Suits Quickly
- If you're down to 1-2 cards of a suit, try to play them
- Being empty in a suit gives you cutting power

### 4. Watch Other Players
- Track which suits are being exhausted
- Predict when someone might cut

### 5. Control the Lead
- Winning tricks lets you choose the next suit
- Lead with suits others might be weak in

## 🎮 Game Variations

### Multiple Rounds
- Play several games in a session
- Keep score of who becomes Kazhutha each time
- Player with most Kazhutha losses buys snacks!

### Speed Kazhutha
- Set a time limit for each turn
- Faster gameplay, more chaotic fun

### Partnership Mode
- In 4-player games, play in teams (partners sit opposite)
- Both partners must empty hands to be safe
